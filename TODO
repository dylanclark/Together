LOGISTICS:

GAMEPLAY:
  - more objects: waterfall? decorative objects, like grass/insects/flowers/what else?
  - variable blocks - switches change them instantly from black to white. easy!
  - each of the level sets should have a gimmick:
      + water
      + blocks that are only active (appear) if the right dot is standing on them.
      + ...and more!
