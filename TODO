BUG LIST
    - white char can get stuck if exactly one tile to the right of a left flooredge

    - first couple levels are just black char

    - green
WORLD 4 (ice cave)
    - sky blue

TO-DO LIST
    - implement "zones": groups of levels that can be navigated like a Metroid map
        + replace level_ends with exits - 2-tile rects that must touch wall and one black and white square
        + camera stays on one level until you reach exit, then pans smoothly to the next level
        + zone-file must have a) starting level and b) characters' starting coordinates. and coordinates of all levels, and palette
        + when chars exit a level they just move 3 tiles in that diraction and an animation plays
        + this means each level needs a border for both chars
    - level editor new features
        + level there can be multiple level ends, and now they must touch the wall and touch adjacent white/black
        + level ends can't be in the corner
        + for now, just draw them as one yellow block
        + they have a direction and coordinates (which ID top left corner as always)
    - zone editor
        + create new zone
        + load levels from any zone or extra storage
        + levels should "click" into place, their exits and entrances lining up


LOGISTICS:
  - general object class, each level can then have a list of objects
  - maybe there's a way to void passing the engine around everywhere?
  - change initialization functions for Dot and things like it: should take arguments (x, y, etc.) and initialize traits

GAMEPLAY:
  - more objects: waterfall? decorative objects, like grass/insects/flowers/what else?
  - water? perhaps a gray tiles that both dots can swim in: something like this:
  - variable blocks - switches change them instantly from black to white. easy!
  - each of the level sets should have a gimmick:
      + water
      + blocks that are only active (appear) if the right dot is standing on them.
      + ...and more!
