Together. is a game that relies on SDL Frameworks to create a window and render objects. We used C++ to take advantage of these SDL Frameworks. It has two characters who interact with objects in their environments to solve puzzles. Here are several high-level descriptions of major design features we implemented:

- Save file.
- Menu and pause screens.
- Options.
- Switching characters.
- Gamepad / Controller support.
- Pushable crates.
- Engine / gamestate system.
- Tile drawing.
- Keyboard input.
- Level select.
- Music.
- Dynamic camera.

- Collision detection.
- Gravity.
- Jumping.
- Levels.
- Level end.
- Customizeable springs and cross-layer springs.
- Customizeable buttons.
- Flipping/turning when rendering.
- Simple animation.
